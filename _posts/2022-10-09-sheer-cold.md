    <h5 class="cyber info-subtitle">What is Hablo Gato exactly?</h5>
    <p>
        <em>Hablo Gato</em> is a prototype VR game that provides a language-immersion experience through speech recognition from the comfort of home, or wherever they may be. Traveling to immerse one's self in a country's language is the best way to learn, but that is a privilege. Compared to the cost of traveling and the development of XR technologies, this could be a very affordable option.

    <h5 class="cyber info-subtitle">Interested in trying Hablo Gato?</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Hablo Gato</em> is currently not available for demoing.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We're still looking at fixing an issue with needing to insert our Azure API key directly into our code. This poses a security for our team members who've signed up for the service.
                </li>
                <li>In the meantime, we've recorded both a <a href src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIcWWMNTfkQ">abbreviated demo</a> and a <a href src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ufRYOeSCDk">full demo</a> for viewing.</li>
