# The Portfolio of Ryan Davis

## Overview
Thanks for taking a look at my portfolio's repo! I made this cost- and space-efficient site to showcase my work as a technical artist focused on shaders and tools.
While I'm not a web developer nor a designer, I still wanted to learn something new while working with my financial situation.

### Technologies & Tools Used
- Vue 3
- GoogleFonts
- Pixsquare (pixel art)

## Design
### Code Structure
The design of this site revolves around helping me save money. At the time of creating the first draft, I did not have a secure job. I opted to use the free 1 GB of hosting GitHub Pages provides and as a result, I needed to find a way to fit all of my content into a relatively small space. This was achieved through manipulating the DOM using Vue's routing and components, a couple of JSON files, and a lot of careful OOP. Even when I compile for deployment, the resulting files in this repo stay under GitHub Page's 1 GB limit since I don't need to start with many source files.

That being said, I also wanted to save space for hosting images and gifs.

### Visual & Web Design
My portfolio's color and accent themes come from the pixel art found on my splash: I wanted to create a tech art symbol for myself while paying homage to my side craft as a pixel artist. Thus, I pixeled a paintbrush and tool crossing surrounded by yellow orchids. Orchids are nice and are one of my and my mom's favorite flowers too, so why not.

The web design is very heavily inspired by [Olenda Shmahalo's portolfio](https://www.olenashmahalo.com/). I stumbled across their portfolio in an art community and admired its functionality and clean organization. I wanted to replicate the features I loved the most, especially the sorting options; I tried to do so while making sure it could work well for not just images, but lots of text as well.
