You play as a questing fungi looking to better the lives of your shroomy homeland by running errands for them. *lARp* tracks the time exercised and steps taken using a pedometer. Along the way, questers can run into friendly and deadly mushrooms. Using GPT-3, players can converse back and forth with unique characters before deciding their fate and defeating them in minigames between quests.
