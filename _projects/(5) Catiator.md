### Let Me Tell You More
<div class="pixel-div">
    <h5 class="cyber info-subtitle">What is Catiator exactly?</h5>
    <p>
        <em>Catiator</em> is a VR game aimed at teaching American Sign Language through gamification. Using the Oculus Quest 2's gesture recognition feature, players practice one-handed signs to defeat charging gladiator cats in a vaporwave colosseum.
    </p>
    <p>
	<strong>Beware</strong>: if enough Catiators get too close, players will be purred and cuddled into defeat.
    </p>

    <h5 class="cyber info-subtitle">The Experience, My Thoughts</h5>
    <p>
        After getting my feet wet in the hackathon world with HackDavis and QWER Hacks, I was excited but really nervous for TreeHacks 2021. I read about how competitive and intense it was. Who would want to work with an older student returning to school for that? Luckily I met my now usual crew, table1, at this very hackathon. It also goes to show that I shouldn’t judge anyone, including myself, based on age because we won, even while having fun and not taking ourselves too seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
        My role on this project was the development of the Catiator, the enemy character the player must fight off with their alphabet signing. I created this character from scratch, excluding its texture maps; this means I produced everything else, ranging from character design to all of its animations.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't consider myself a 3D animator in the slightest (especially on a lack of sleep after working 24 hours straight!) but instead a green 3D generalist with a majority of her knowledge self-taught. Recalling how to do each stage of the 3D animation pipeline in Autodesk Maya from memory was a highlight of this hackathon for me. It gave me back that thrill of why I was interested in 3D and graphics in the first place: it is the perfect marriage of art and computer science.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I’m not particularly interested in going back into the animation industry, <em>Catiator</em> showed me that XR is also an embodiment of art and computer science, one that will allow me more freedom to program and be a hybrid concerning my skill set. Looking back, I have to say that this is the project that got me even more into developing for XR specifically. I’m honored to have worked on it!
